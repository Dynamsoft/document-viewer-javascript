[Dynamsoft Document Viewer (DDV)](https://www.dynamsoft.com/document-viewer/docs/introduction/index.html) is a versatile SDK designed to offer a range of viewers for configuring and executing various document processing workflows.

Key features include:

- Data Management: Organize, retrieve, and manage documents and pages efficiently.

- Viewer Types: Customize your document interaction with a variety of viewers.

Additionally, DDV enhances functionality by allowing integration with customized image filtering processes and document boundary detection processes. It is particularly recommended to use [Dynamsoft Document Normalizer](https://www.dynamsoft.com/document-normalizer/docs/web/programming/javascript/) for document detection.

DDV enables the seamless creation of a document management web application tailored to your specific workflow, user interface, and style needs.

## Features

Generally, the features of DDV can be divided to two parts as below.

### Data Management

Data management is to manage the data which is imported into DDV. It is managed from the following two aspects:

- Document Management: Document creation/deletion/merging, etc.
- Page management: Pages in documents loading/saving/deleting/moving, etc.

### Viewers

Viewers are used to display the data. According to the different uses of viewers, DDV provides five different viewer types, which are implemented through five viewer classes.

- Edit Viewer: Edit the pages in document, such as, rotating, cropping, filtering, etc. and adjust the layout of the display.
- Capture Viewer: Control camera, play video stream, and capture the images from camera.
- Perspective Viewer: Do page boundary manual adjustment & perspective transformation.
- Browse Viewer: Display pages in multiple-mode, pages can be multiple selected.
- Custom Viewer: No built-in UI or functionality, which is used for creating your own viewer.
